  caveats <<~EOS
    Coral bundles its own tmux; nothing else needs to be installed.

    Launch Coral from your Applications folder or Spotlight.
    The dashboard runs at http://localhost:8420.

    The `coral`, `coral-board` and `coral-agent` command-line tools are not on
    your PATH by default. To add them:
      #{appdir}/Coral.app/Contents/MacOS/install-cli.sh
  EOS
